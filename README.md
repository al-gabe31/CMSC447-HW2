<h2>Searching for a row</h2>
<p>You can also search for a specific row, granted that all the fields in inputs match. If there is a math for all 3 inputs, then the webpage will jump you straight to that row. It'll also highlight the row in green! If there is no match, then an alert will show up informing you that the inputs don't match any of the rows.</p>
